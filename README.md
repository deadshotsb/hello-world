# IRIS Classification 

The IRIS Classification dataset is largely considered as a "Hello World" of Machine Leaening. This is based on a kaggle dataset. the main aim of this project is to classify an iris into three categories based on some charecteristics.

The packages used in this repository are:-

1. numpy
2. seaborn
3. matplotlib
4. pandas
5. sklearn

The main motive behind this project was to introduce myself in the world of Machine Learning. The project mainly deals with classifying the plant species based on the structure of their iris.
