# hello-world

Hello Everyone,

This is Sombit,I am interested in coding and algorithms and know languages like C,C++,java,python.
Looking forward to contribute in Github.

I am a Data Science Enthusiast. I love Tableau and Power BI for visualization.

# IRIS Classification 

The IRIS Classification dataset is largely considered as a "Hello World" of Machine Leaening. This is based on a kaggle dataset. the main aim of this project is to classify an iris into three categories based on some charecteristics.

## Installations ## 

This project uses **Python 3.x**, so a suitable python version (>=3.6) is advisable.

The project uses the following packages:- 
<ul>
  <li> numpy </li>
  <li> pandas </li>
  <li> matplotlib </li>
  <li> sklearn </li>
  <li> seaborn </li>
</ul>

## Local Machine installation ##
If you do not have a working installation of these packages, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using `pip`

`pip install <package name >`

or `conda`:

`conda install <package name>`

## Project Motivation ## 

The main motive behind this project was to introduce myself in the world of Machine Learning. The project mainly deals with classifying the plant species based on the structure of their iris. The main questions asked in this problem were:-
    
    1. Which are the factors that can help in the prediction of the species of iris?
    2. Can a Predictive model be build for predicting the outcome?

## Summary of the Result ##

A Decision Tree Classifier was used for Prediction and it is able to predict the Iris species efficiently.

##  File Descriptions ##

There are two working files and an image file in this repository.

The Comma Separated Value (Border-Crossing-Entry-Data.csv) file contains the entire dataset.

The Jupyter notebook (IRIS_Classification.ipynb) file contains the project.

The image(.png) file is used to supplement the Jupyter notebook. (Source : Google images)
